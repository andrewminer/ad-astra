Ad Astra is a transportation-focused modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2.  With it, you
can go from travelling on your own two feet to travelling among the stars in
your warp-capable starship.  And the world of Ad Astra is worth travelling in...
realistic hills, valleys, mountains, oceans and islands are populated with
realistic trees and a variety of plant and animal life.

To help you in your travels, you've got a wide variety of vehicles available.
Of course, you've always got the trusty wooden raft, but you can also make motor
boats, and even huge, multi-block ships.  On land, the vanilla horses have been
augmented so you can breed them for desirable traits, but that's just the start.
Make your self motorcycles, dune buggies, trucks, and even trailers.  You can
even create a light aircraft to fly from one place to another, or make a huge
airship to carry a mobile home to and fro.  The pinnacle, of course, is to make
a rocket to launch a space station, and even a warp-capable starship.

And, you're going to need to travel.  Most resources only appear in specific
biomes, and those biomes are spread out just like the real world.  You're going
to need to move around quite a bit to find everything you'll need.  However,
with lots of cool extras to build with, when you find the perfect place to make
that ancient Japanese temple, you'll have more than enough cool blocks at hand
to do it.

But, you're going to *want* to travel.  With realistic terrain unlike what
you've seen in Minecraft before.  Low sandy beaches give way to smooth grassy
plains which ripple into low hills before exploding into long ranges of
mountains.  Realistic trees gradually grow from saplings to tower above you.
And all among them are 100+ species of animals: some out in the daytime, some
only out at night.  Careful, though... not all of them a friendly!

Finally, Ad Astra is a high-tech place.  Oil refineries, nuclear power plants,
rocket fuel plants, and space stations are all things you'll need to build here,
and you've got the tech to do it.  Power systems, items pipes, and a lot of
compact, high-tech machinery to help you.  So, strap on your boots, grab your
saddle, and get ready for a journey to the stars!


### Using the wiki

Ad Astra has a lot of mods, and many of those have been altered to work better
together.  Plus, it has a *lot* of custom world generation, so you won't be able
to find things in their usual places.  Finally, there have been more than a few
little tweaks to both make things harder, easier, and just more integrated.
The wiki will describe what you need to know to navigate the new terrain.
Here's where to start:
