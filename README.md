Ad Astra is a modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2 focused on transportation: from your own two feet onward to the stars!



### Transportation

The main focus of the modpack is transporation.  Of course, you start out on your own two feet, and perhaps manage to
befriend a horse.  However, your options hardly end there.  With the Vehicle Mod, you can make loads of small vehicles
for land, sea, and even air!  If you want something more substantial, you can use DaVinci's Vessels to make ships to
sail the seas, or Railcraft to make networks of railroads. The real end game, though, is traavelling first to space in
chemical rockets, and then to *other stars* in your wrap-drive capable ship using Advanced Rockets.

### Navigation Aids

Part of the challenge in this modpack is not only getting around, but knowing where you are going!  Ad Astra has no
conventional mini-map, and no in-game coordinates.  Instead, Antique Atlas, Information Accessories, and a few other
mods provide devices you can make in-game to provide you with navigational guidance.

### World Generation

In order to make the world a place worth travelling, there are a lot of changes from a vanilla Minecraft world. First,
Realistic Terrain Generation creates hills, valleys, mountains, you'd expect to find in the real world, and
GeographiCraft populates them with a realistic placement of biomes.  Heading north or south will bring colder and warmer
climates. DynamicTrees brings the whole world to life with seeds that grow into full-sized trees and eventually die off.
And, thanks to In Control, mobs only appear in dark, underground spaces, so you can stay safe even at night.

### Technology

Ad Astra is a high-tech world.  Thermal Expansion provides a full suite of compact machines and devices for harnessing
the power of the natural world while ProjectRed gives you the logic circuits to take full control of automating it. When
you're ready for more power, Lightening Rods lets you harness the power in the sky, and Extreme Reactors lets you
harness the radioactive powers buried deep in the Earth.  With all that juice at your disposal, you can hook up force
fields, teleporters, and other high-tech devices with RF Tools, or even set up matter-energy storage system with Refined
Storage.

### Tools & Equipment

Travelling is dangerous and tiring work, so bring a sleeping bag or hammock courtesy of the Comforts mod, and tote your
essential supplies thanks to the Wearable Backpacks mod. You can even bring a lunchbox from Spice of Life to make sure
you get a healthy variety of nutrition.  However, not everywhere is safe, so equip yourself with arms and armor from
Restone Arsenal to avoid dangers in the deep places of the world.  And, if you should need to repair your broken gear,
the Reconstructor mod has you covered.

### Architecture & Decoration

For when you're not travelling, or if you want to make destinations worth travelling to, there's a wide array of useful
an decorative blocks available, from furniture (BiblioCraft, McCrayfish's Furniture Mod), to architectural elements
(ArchitectureCraft, Chinese Workshop, MCW's mods, Malisis' Doors), to handy decorative blocks (Chisel, Online Picture
Frame, Simply Light).  Finally, if nothing else will do, make your own decorative blocks with Chisels & Bits.

### Agriculture

To sustain yourself on your journeys, HarvestCraft and its companions provide an enormous variety of fruits, vegetables,
and other foodstuffs to keep you full and satisfied. You'll need it as Spice of Life will make sure you can't survive on
a diet of only baked potatoes!  To help you set up a working kitchen, use the tools from Cooking for Blockheads to track
your recipies and help with the cooking.

### Storage & Crafting

One can accmulate a lot stuff in ones travels, and you'll need a lot of stuff to make build your rockets, space
stations, and other vehicles.  That can get just a bit overwhelming if all you have are a few wooden boxes.  Storage
Drawers (and it's companion, Compact Drawers) will give you a much more sophisticated (but still low-tech) solution,
while Refined Storage will give you the ultimate answer in its computerized matter-energy storage system. And, in case
you don't want to trade with other players, you can used a Vending Block to set up a shop stall for others to use.

### Game Dynamics

There's nothing worse than being a long way from home, and having an... accident.  You stuff gets scattered all over,
and there's no hope of getting back to the scene before it vanishes.  The Corpse mod leaves your body behind with all
its items intact for you (or a friend... or enemy) to recover later.  Morpheus, the god of slumber, will make sure
everyone sleeps when anyone does.  Finally, it will no longer do to survive on an unrelenting diet of baked potatoes and
apples; Spice of Life will ensure that you have a rotation of at least 6 items in your diet and provides the handy lunch
box to automatically pick a healthy selection for you.

### UI Improvements

Let's face it... Minecraft's user interface can be pretty clunky.  Inventory Tweaks and Mouse Tweaks make moving items
around a bit easier, while No Recipe Book and Toast Control remove some further annoyances.  OptiFine will help you
computer with the drawing (and even provides shader support if you have a super fancy rig).  Finally, Just Enough Items
and its family of plug-ins will help you remember all the hundreds of recipes all the advanced tech provides.

### Integration & Fine-Tuning

With pretty close to 120 mods, Ad Astra is a pretty complex modpack, with a lot of incompatibilities and strange
overlaps between its various mods.  CraftTweaker and its various plugins have been invaluable in sorting out the chaos
behind the scenes.  You'll never know they're there, but when you figure out that you can make a bucket from tin ingots
or that fuel for you McCrayfish vehicle can be made with a Thermal Expansion refinery, it's CraftTweaker you have to
thank.
